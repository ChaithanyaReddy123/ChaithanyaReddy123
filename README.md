## Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹
I am ***Chaithanya*** from Andhra Pradesh,India. Currently working as full stack engineer at OPTUM with over 2.5 years of experience.
I enjoy tackling algorithmic challenges, optimizing code, and solving real-world problems using DSA and system design principles. 

My ability to debug complex issues and improve application performance makes me an asset in fast-paced agile environments.

Always eager to collaborate, mentor, and explore emerging technologies that push the boundaries of efficiency and innovation.
